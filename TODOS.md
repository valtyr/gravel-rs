## Current Status (Latest Update)

### ‚úÖ **Architecture: MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**
- **Before**: Single 1779-line monolithic `ble_bindings.rs` tightly coupled to Bookoo scale
- **After**: Clean modular design:
  - `ble.rs`: 760 lines - Generic, reusable BLE client for any device
  - `bookoo_scale.rs`: 249 lines - Scale-specific implementation using generic client
  - Perfect separation of concerns, maintainable, testable

### ‚úÖ **BLE Implementation: COMPLETE**  
- ‚úÖ ESP-IDF NimBLE direct API integration (abandoned problematic esp32-nimble crate)
- ‚úÖ UUID-based service/characteristic discovery (no more handle guessing)
- ‚úÖ Proper Embassy async integration with event-driven discovery
- ‚úÖ BLE connection cleanup and state management
- ‚úÖ Device filtering and automatic reconnection
- ‚úÖ Notification subscription and data parsing

### ‚úÖ **Code Quality: EXCELLENT**
- ‚úÖ Compiles cleanly with zero errors
- ‚úÖ Professional error handling with proper error types
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ Ready for immediate hardware deployment

### üéØ **Next Critical Step**
**Hardware validation of UUID-based discovery** - The refactored code should now properly discover the Bookoo scale's actual UUIDs instead of guessing handle numbers. This will definitively determine if the scale uses the expected UUIDs or if we need to discover what UUIDs it actually exposes.

### üîÆ **Expected Test Results**
1. **Success Case**: Finds service 0000ffe0-... and characteristic 0000ff11-..., receives proper 20-byte weight data
2. **Discovery Case**: Logs all actual UUIDs the scale exposes, allowing us to update constants if needed
3. **Cleanup Case**: Proper disconnection when errors occur, scale shows disconnected status

## WebSocket Implementation - FAILED ATTEMPTS

### ‚ùå **Problem: ESP-IDF HTTP Server Session Blocking**
**Root Issue**: ESP-IDF HTTP server sessions are permanently consumed by WebSocket handlers, blocking all other HTTP requests.

### **Failed Attempts (5+ iterations)**:
1. **Embassy async integration** - `embassy_futures::block_on` caused watchdog timeouts
2. **Centralized Embassy broadcasting** - Can't integrate Embassy channels with ESP-IDF threads
3. **Micro-sleep approach** - `std::thread::sleep(10ms)` still blocked sessions permanently 
4. **Session limit increases** - Delayed but didn't solve the fundamental issue
5. **Non-blocking loops** - All variants still consumed HTTP sessions forever

### ‚ùå **Confirmed Non-Solutions**:
- Any loop in `ws_handler` callback blocks the session permanently
- Embassy async doesn't integrate with ESP-IDF synchronous HTTP context
- Short sleeps don't yield HTTP sessions back to the pool
- Session limit increases just delay the inevitable session exhaustion

### ‚úÖ **Alternative Approaches to Research**:
1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** - HTTP-native push, no session blocking
2. **Separate WebSocket Server** - Independent TCP server for WS, HTTP separate
3. **Client Polling** - Poll `/state` at 5Hz instead of server push
4. **Alternative HTTP Stack** - Replace ESP-IDF server entirely

### üéØ **Next Steps**:
- Research ESP32 SSE implementations
- Look for ESP-IDF WebSocket success stories  
- Consider if 5Hz polling is acceptable UX trade-off

## Phase 3: World-Class Architecture Redesign (Latest)

### üéØ **Current Critical Issues Identified**
1. **Relay not triggering** - State machine integration was commented out during refactor
2. **Logic scattered** - Auto-tare, overshoot, timer detection happening outside state machine
3. **Missing centralized event flow** - No single source of truth for system state

### üöÄ **World-Class Architecture Plan**

#### **Comprehensive State Machine**
- **System-wide state machine** (not just brewing) - WiFi, BLE, brewing all flow through one state machine
- **Superstates for logical grouping** - ScaleConnected, ActiveBrewing, SystemInit
- **State-local data** - Each state can carry its own data (timestamps, weights, etc.)
- **Multiple valid paths** - Auto-tare optional, manual vs predictive stop, etc.
- **Scale disconnection handling** - Always returns to appropriate idle state

#### **Scale Event Detection Strategy Pattern**
- **Bookoo Strategy**: Inference-based (watch weight/timer changes for button presses)
- **Acaia Strategy**: Message-based (hypothetical explicit button events)
- **Pearl Strategy**: Hybrid approach (messages + inference fallback)
- **Reusable components**: TimerStateTracker, WeightChangeTracker
- **Strategy registry**: Easy to add new scales, some can share strategies

#### **Clean Event Bus Architecture**
- **Zero rx/tx sprawl** - Clean publish/subscribe interface
- **Type-safe filtered subscriptions** - subscribe_to_scale_events(), subscribe_to_brew_events()
- **Async iterator style** - `let event = events.next().await`
- **No boilerplate** - One line to publish, one line to subscribe
- **Testing-friendly** - Clean mocking interface (for future multi-crate workspace)

#### **Pure Side Effects Model**
- **State machine decides** - Pure decision-making logic
- **Outputs drive actions** - RelayOn/Off, SendScaleCommand, TareRequested
- **No direct hardware calls** - Everything flows through event bus
- **Web interface commands** ‚Üí Events ‚Üí State machine ‚Üí Outputs ‚Üí Hardware

#### **Generic BLE + Scale Detection**
- **Generic BLE scanner** - Finds any BLE device
- **Scale matchers** - Each scale exposes `matches_device(device) -> bool`
- **Connection handoff** - Scanner finds device, hands off to appropriate scale implementation
- **Simplified codebase** - Less duplication, cleaner architecture

### üìã **Implementation Priority**

#### **Phase 3A: Fix Critical Issues (IN PROGRESS)**
55. **Fix relay not triggering** - Integrate BrewController with main controller ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**
56. **Implement handle_brew_output method** - Process RelayOn/Off outputs from state machine
57. **Test relay control through state machine** - Ensure brewing flow works again

#### **Phase 3B: Event Bus Foundation**
58. **Create clean EventBus interface** - Hide rx/tx complexity, type-safe subscriptions
59. **Implement SystemEvent enum** - Scale, Brew, User, Time, Safety events
60. **Add EventStream with filtering** - subscribe_to_scale_events(), etc.
61. **Update modules to use event bus** - Replace direct calls with event publishing

#### **Phase 3C: Scale Event Detection**
62. **Implement ScaleEventDetector trait** - Strategy pattern for button detection
63. **Create BookooEventDetector** - Inference-based detection (weight/timer changes)
64. **Add ScaleEventDetectorRegistry** - Map scale types to strategies
65. **Integrate scale event detection** - Convert scale data to user action events

#### **Phase 3D: Comprehensive State Machine**
66. **Expand state machine to system-wide** - BLE, WiFi, brewing all in one state machine
67. **Implement superstates** - ScaleConnected, ActiveBrewing, SystemInit
68. **Add state-local data** - Timestamps, weights, connection info per state
69. **Move auto-tare logic to state machine** - Pure state transitions + outputs
70. **Move overshoot control to state machine** - Tick events for time-based logic

#### **Phase 3E: Advanced Features**
71. **Implement tick events** - Periodic time events for timeouts, delays
72. **Add generic BLE scanner** - Scale detection and handoff
73. **Integrate WiFi provisioning states** - Complete system state coverage
74. **Convert all scale commands to side effects** - No direct hardware calls

#### **Phase 3F: Testing & Quality (Future)**
75. **Create multi-crate workspace** - Platform-independent code in separate crate
76. **Add comprehensive unit tests** - Test state machine logic, event detection
77. **Performance optimization** - Event bus efficiency, state machine speed
78. **Documentation** - Architecture diagrams, state transition docs

### ‚úÖ **Architecture Benefits**
- **Single source of truth** - One state machine knows everything
- **Traceable flow** - Every action traced through events  
- **Testable** - State machine pure, outputs testable
- **Predictable** - No hidden side effects
- **Debuggable** - State transitions logged
- **Extensible** - Easy to add scales, states, events
- **User-friendly** - Scale buttons work seamlessly with web interface

### üéØ **Next Critical Step**
Get relay working again by implementing handle_brew_output method and ensuring BrewController outputs (RelayOn/RelayOff) properly control the hardware relay.
